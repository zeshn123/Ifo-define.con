    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Our story began in 2008 when our founder, Mr.Zeeshan, ventured into online business in Pakistan, way before the advent of the digital revolution we see today. With his expertise in web development, SEO, digital marketing, and financial marketing, Mr. Nawaz started freelancing in 2011, offering his services to various clients.

        In 2014, Ifodefine.com was launched, and since then, we have been dedicated to helping people earn a good income and start their own businesses. Our efforts were recognized when Mr.Zeeshan was declared "Partner of the Year" by Exness, a forex portal, in 2015.
        
        As part of our commitment to sharing knowledge, we began conducting frequent seminars in 2017, benefiting thousands of people in Dubai, Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Islamabad, and Gujranwala. We have also established a strong online presence with over 50,000 active traders, 35,000 YouTube subscribers, 58,000 Facebook followers, 15,000 Whatsapp and Instagram group members, and 35,000 email contacts.
        
        Mr.Zeeshan has now become a renowned financial trainer, motivational speaker, digital entrepreneur, business planner, forex trader, and social activist. He also inspires and motivates new graduates and beginners in the business through his Youtube channel, Raheel Wheelchairwala.
        
        Join us on our mission to reshape the future of online trading with free forex training in Urdu/Hindi about forex analysis, signals, indicators, and robots. Discover how we can help you achieve financial freedom and become a successful trader today.
